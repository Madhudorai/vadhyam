Attempt to build virtual carnatic accompanist that is raga agnostic, doesn't run on GPUs or use generative AI
Create a virtual environment with **python3.10**. activate the virtualenvironment. then, **pip install the requirements**.

# PART A
Run the accompanistv1.py code. Press ctrl C to stop. Uses DDSP, sine wave synthesizer output of last 3 seconds (captures more glides, noise)

# PART B
Run the instrumentalist.py code. Press ctrl C to stop. This creates MIDI file of last 5 seconds, using BasicPitch - plays through soundfont (instrument-preset)/ synthesizer, if any error.
   
# Demo PART-A: Begada raga alapana
